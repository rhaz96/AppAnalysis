# Finding profitable app profiles on Google Play and the App Store

Imagine being approached by app developers who are curious about the most profitable types of free apps in the Google Play and Apple App stores.  They want to develop a free app (or apps) supported by advertising that would hopefully become mainstream in the future.  Before doing so, they want to be sure they're focusing their efforts in a fruitful app category.  What would that category (or categories) be?  We find out in this project.

## Getting Started

The requisite datasets are *AppleStore.csv* and *googleplaystore.csv*. Make sure to have these datasets saved in the same folder (working directory).  

The analysis is done with Python in a Jupyter notebook environent.  If you'd like to reproduce this project, you'll need to have Jupyter installed first on your computer.  If you don't have Jupyter installed already, check this [guide](https://jupyter.org/install) out to see how.

Once installed, create a Jupyter notebook in the same folder where the datasets are stored.

## Motivation
Personal goals of this project include using Python to build functions that open and read data, clean up incorrect data, and extract insights relevant to the project's objective.  

## Acknowledgements
The data is provided by Kaggle via Dataquest.
