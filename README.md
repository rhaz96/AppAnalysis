# Finding profitable app profiles on Google Play and the App Store

This project is an exercise in data cleaning and analysis of app data. The (imaginary) stakeholder is a developer community seeking advice on what free app profiles are most profitable.  

The analysis is done with Python using lists and dictionaries. The requisite data can be found in *AppleStore.csv* and *googleplaystore.csv*.
